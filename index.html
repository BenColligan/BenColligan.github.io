<h1>The 1050 and the 1050ti, whats the difference?</h1>

<p><img src="http://images.isportstimes.com/data/thumbs/full/10926/720/0/0/0/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050.jpg" alt="Nvidia GTX 1050")</p>

<p>This is a GTX Geforce 1050 and 1050ti, It is a budget level GPU aimed at individuals who want to game too the max (settings) at 1920x1080 resolution. So, we have established that now I hear people ask 'Why is this so exciting compared
to other GPUs?' Well, Thats what I will explain now! You see the 1050 has 2GB of VRAM, the recommended ammount If you want to game at the resolution 1920x1080, and it is retailed at $109 (£115) now thats all well and good but what really
excites everyone out there is the 1050ti. The 1050ti has 4GB of VRAM, not so amazing If you remember other GPUs like the Titan XP have WAY more VRAM, although the tickler for the 1050ti is the price... It only retails at $139 (£139) That's
only another $24 for another 2GBs of VRAM! This is an amazing card for people wanting to play basically any game at 1080p at max setting... It gets 4.5 out of 5 STARS!</p>

<h1>More RAM... or faster RAM? That is the question.</h1>

<p>Around about a week ago I was in the middle of browsering the interwebs! (Mostly YouTube.) and came across a video which looked very interesting in a computer hyper nerds eyes, which I obviously am, Anyways this video was published by
Blunty (https://www.youtube.com/user/Blunty3000, Tell him PCInformer sent you ;)) and within this video he toke A. 4GBs of DDR4 HyperX Fury @ 2133Mhz and B. 16GBs of DDR4 HyperX Fury @ 2666Mhz. I am not going to try to 'take his views away' by
ruining all of the infomation this video has to offer but today I am just talking about the ammount of intrest you can get from a video like this. For example, If your a computer nerd, like me, then you will find this video immensely and oddly
satisfying. Alas! Go! Go watch this brilliant video by this brilliant man! I will wait... also tweet me @BenColligan speaking your opinion of this video *cough* *cough*</p>
