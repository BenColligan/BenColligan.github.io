<p>This is a GTX Geforce 1050 and 1050ti, It is a budget level GPU aimed at individuals who want to game too the max (settings) at 1920x1080 resolution. So, we have established that now I hear people ask 'Why is this so exciting compared
to other GPUs?' Well, Thats what I will explain now! You see the 1050 has 2GB of VRAM, the recommended ammount If you want to game at the resolution 1920x1080, and it is retailed at $109 (£115) now thats all well and good but what really
excites everyone out there is the 1050ti. The 1050ti has 4GB of VRAM, not so amazing If you remember other GPUs like the Titan XP have WAY more VRAM, although the tickler for the 1050ti is the price... It only retails at $139 (£139) That's
only another $24 for another 2GBs of VRAM! This is an amazing card for people wanting to play basically any game at 1080p at max setting... It gets 4.5 out of 5 STARS!</p>
